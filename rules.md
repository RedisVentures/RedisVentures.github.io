## ðŸ“œ Rules of Engagement

- Teams must be limited to **4 or less** participants to qualify.
- Hackathon submissions must be made by end of day **November 4th 2022**.
- This is a community focused event.
    - The use of profanity, inappropriate conduct, or intimidation / threatening behavior will not be tolerated and will require the immediate removal of your team from entry.
- Using external resources is encouraged! But stealing/copying someone else's solution is a bad look.
    - Help eachother out! But don't straight up copy another participants content.
