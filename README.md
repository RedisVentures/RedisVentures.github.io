# Overview
### October 24 2022 - November 4 2022

[Redis](https://redis.io/), [MLOps Community](https://mlops.community/), [NVIDIA Inception](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/), and [Saturn Cloud](https://saturncloud.io/) are collaborating to host an Engineering Lab (Hackathon) centered on **Vector Search** using the [arXiv scholarly papers](https://arxiv.org/) dataset.

Teams will leverage tools & techniques including:
- **Vector Similarity Search**
- **NLP**
- **Text Mining**
- **Knowledge Graphs**
- **Document Retrieval**
- **Topic Identification**
- **Question & Answering**
- **Recommendation Systems**
